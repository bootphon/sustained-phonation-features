# Sustained Phonation Features

Code to replicate the features from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05365


## Installing the environment

To run the experiment's notebook, the creation of a conda environment
is required. Make sure you have conda installed, and are `cd`'ed into 
the project's folder, and run

```shell script
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pho_features
```

You should be then good to go

## Extracting the features

Make sure you have installed and activated the aforementioned conda environment,
then launch a jupyter notebook, and reach the `Sustained Phonation.ipynb` file
in the interface.

```shell script
jupyter notebook 
```
